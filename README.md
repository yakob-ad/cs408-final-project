# Yakob's Restaurant Ordering & Ingredient Tracker

## Project Spec

### <u>Project Overview</u>
This project is a **full‑stack web application** designed to help restaurants manage customer orders and track the ingredients required to fulfill them. The application will be built entirely from scratch without front‑end frameworks, using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the client side, and **AWS services** (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB) for the backend.  

The goal is to demonstrate mastery of core web development concepts: building a responsive front‑end, connecting to a cloud‑based backend, handling CRUD operations, sanitizing user input, and ensuring accessibility. By the end, the app will provide a practical tool for chefs and restaurant staff to streamline order management and ingredient tracking.

### <u>Theme</u>
The theme is **restaurant order management**. Unlike customer‑facing apps (like Uber Eats), this project focuses on the **chef’s perspective**: receiving orders, breaking them down into required ingredients, and ensuring the kitchen has the right quantities on hand.  

This theme is chosen because it naturally involves multiple pages, forms, conditional data retrieval, and dynamic displays — all aligning perfectly with the project grading rubric.


### <u>Core Functionality</u>
At its core, the app will support the following features:

- **Landing Page (index.html):**
  - Welcomes users with a simple introduction.
  - Provides navigation to other pages.
  - Includes a form for submitting a new order (customer name, dish, quantity).

- **Order Submission Page:**
  - A dedicated form page for entering new orders.
  - Data is sent to AWS via API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB.
  - Input sanitization ensures safe handling of customer names and dish details.

- **Order Dashboard Page:**
  - Displays all current orders in a dynamic table.
  - Includes a “Retrieve All Orders” button.
  - Allows deletion of orders via a “Delete” button next to each entry.
  - Conditional retrieval: filter orders by dish type, date, or customer.

- **Ingredient Tracker Page:**
  - Aggregates all orders to calculate total ingredient requirements.
  - Displays a list of ingredients and quantities needed for the day.
  - Helps chefs plan shopping and prep.


### <u>Target Audience</u>
The primary audience is **restaurant staff** — chefs, kitchen managers, and possibly front‑of‑house staff who need visibility into orders.  

Secondary audiences could include:
- **Students learning web development** (as a demo project).
- **Small catering businesses** who need lightweight order tracking without complex POS systems.


### <u>Data Model</u>
The app will manage dynamic data generated by user input:

- **Orders:**
  - Customer name
  - Dish name
  - Quantity
  - Timestamp

- **Ingredients:**
  - Derived from dish definitions (e.g., “Pizza” requires flour, cheese, tomato sauce).
  - Aggregated totals across all orders.

This data will be stored in **AWS DynamoDB**, with Lambda functions handling CRUD operations.


### <u>Technical Stack</u>
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML: Semantic structure for accessibility.
  - CSS: Custom styles (minimum 21+ for A grade).
  - JavaScript: Fetch API calls to AWS endpoints, dynamic DOM updates, input sanitization, unit tests.

- **Backend (AWS):**
  - API Gateway: Exposes REST endpoints.
  - Lambda: Handles business logic (create, read, delete orders).
  - DynamoDB: Stores order and ingredient data.


### <u>Meeting Grading Requirements</u>
- **C‑ Level:** Landing page, form submission, retrieve all orders, delete orders, basic CSS.  
- **B‑ Level:** Three distinct pages (landing, order form, dashboard), conditional retrieval, more CSS styles.  
- **B Level:** Custom CSS per page, authored tests for JS functions (e.g., sanitization, filtering).  
- **A‑ Level:** Input sanitization, 80%+ JS test coverage, four distinct pages (landing, order form, dashboard, ingredient tracker).  
- **A Level:** Accessibility compliance (perfect Lighthouse score), 21+ CSS styles, polished UI.  


### <u>Stretch Goals</u>
Once the core requirements are met, here's some additional features I might add for fun:  
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Charts showing most popular dishes, busiest times, ingredient usage trends.  
- **Shopping List Export:** Generate a downloadable list of ingredients needed for the day.  


### <u>Accessibility & Testing</u>
Accessibility will be a priority:
- Semantic HTML (proper headings, labels, alt text).  
- High‑contrast color schemes.  
- Keyboard navigation support.  

Testing will include:
- Unit tests for JavaScript functions (sanitization, filtering, DOM updates).  
- Coverage reports to ensure 80%+ coverage.  
- Manual Lighthouse checks for accessibility.
